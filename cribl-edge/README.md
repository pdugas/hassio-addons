## About

This add-on installs the [Cribl Edge] agent for exploring, collecting, transforming, and routing logs and metrics. 

Every Cribl Edge install comes with a Free license that allows for processing of up to 1 TB/day. This license requires sending anonymized [Telemetry Data] to Cribl. You may also sign up for a [Cribl.Cloud] account to get free access to Stream, Search, and Lake as well as a Leader to manage them all. See the [Cribl Docs] and [Cribl University] to learn more.

## Security

Home Assistant add-ons start locked down pretty tightly. We've opened up a few things for Edge to get access to to make it more usable for typical uses. The addition access granted to the add-on are listed below.

1. host network access so it can option ports for Sources like Syslog, SNMP Traps, Metrics, and others
1. read-only access to Home Assistant's `config/` directory for access to the `home-assistant.log` for log collection with the File Monitor Source
1. read-only access to the host's journald files for the Journald Source
1. access to the Supervisor and Home Assistant APIs

Access to the Cribl Edge UI/API is internal, via Home Assistant's _Ingress_ feature and not accessible externally.

## Support
